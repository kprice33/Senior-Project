            <h4>THE NAME OF THE WIND</h4>
            <p>My name is Kvothe, pronounced nearly the same as "quothe." Names are important as they tell you a great deal about a person. I've had more names than anyone has a right to. The Adem call me Maedre. Which, depending on how it's spoken, can mean The Flame, The Thunder, or The Broken Tree.<br>

                <br>"The Flame" is obvious if you've ever seen me. I have red hair, bright. If I had been born a couple of hundred years ago I would probably have been burned as a demon. I keep it short but it's unruly. When left to its own devices, it sticks up and makes me look as if I have been set afire.<br>
                
                <br>"The Thunder" I attribute to a strong baritone and a great deal of stage training at an early age.<br>
                
               <br>I've never thought of "The Broken Tree" as very significant. Although in retrospect, I suppose it could be considered at least partially prophetic.<br>
                
               <br> My first mentor called me E'lir because I was clever and I knew it. My first real lover called me Dulator because she liked the sound of it. I have been called Shadicar, Lightfinger, and Six-String. I have been called Kvothe the Bloodless, Kvothe the Arcane, and Kvothe Kingkiller. I have earned those names. Bought and paid for them.<br>
                
                <br>But I was brought up as Kvothe. My father once told me it meant "to know."<br>
                
               <br>I have, of course, been called many other things. Most of them uncouth, although very few were unearned.<br>
                
                <br>I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep.<br>
                
               <br>You may have heard of me.<br>
                
               <br>So begins the tale of Kvothe from his childhood in a troupe of traveling players, to years spent as a near-feral orphan in a crime-riddled city, to his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a difficult and dangerous school of magic. In these pages you will come to know Kvothe as a notorious magician, an accomplished thief, a masterful musician, and an infamous assassin. But The Name of the Wind is so much more for the story it tells reveals the truth behind Kvothe's legend.</p>

            <h4>THE WISE MAN FEARS</h4>
            <p>In The Wise Man's Fear, Kvothe searches for answers, attempting to uncover the truth about the mysterious Amyr, the Chandrian, and the death of his parents. Along the way, Kvothe is put on trial by the legendary Adem mercenaries, forced to reclaim the honor of his family, and travels into the Fae realm. There he meets Felurian, the faerie woman no man can resist, and who no man has ever survived...until Kvothe.<br>

                <br>Now, Kvothe takes his first steps on the path of the hero and learns how difficult life can be when a man becomes a legend in his own time.</p>

            <h4>THE SLOW REGARD FOR SILENT THINGS</h4>
            <p>Deep below the University, there is a dark place. Few people know of it: a broken web of ancient passageways and abandoned rooms. A young woman lives there, tucked among the sprawling tunnels of the Underthing, snug in the heart of this forgotten place.<br>

            <br>Her name is Auri, and she is full of mysteries.<br>
                            
            <br>The Slow Regard of Silent Things is a brief, bittersweet glimpse of Auris life, a small adventure all her own. At once joyous and haunting, this story offers a chance to see the world through Auris eyes. And it gives the reader a chance to learn things that only Auri knows....<br>
                            
            <br>In this book, Patrick Rothfuss brings us into the world of one of The Kingkiller Chronicles most enigmatic characters. Full of secrets and mysteries, The Slow Regard of Silent Things is the story of a broken girl trying to live in a broken world.</p>

                <h4>THE NARROW ROAD BETWEEN DESIRES</h4>
                <p>Bast knows how to bargain. The give-and-take of a negotiation is as familiar to him as the in-and-out of breathing; to watch him trade is to watch an artist at work. But even a master's brush can slip. When he accepts a gift, taking something for nothing, Bast's whole world is knocked askew, for he knows how to bargain--but not how to owe.<br>

                <br>From dawn to midnight over the course of a single day, follow the Kingkiller Chronicle's most charming fae as he schemes and sneaks, dancing into trouble and back out again with uncanny grace.<br>
                
                <br>The Narrow Road Between Desires is Bast's story. In it he traces the old ways of making and breaking, following his heart even when doing so goes against his better judgement.<br>
                
               <br>After all, what good is caution if it keeps him from danger and delight?</p>
